#yaml  must be in the document header if using html and written in html syntax
#example:
    #abstract: |
    #<p>I am an abstract.</p>
# Should be written at top of document in non-LaTeX syntax if using wkhtmltopdf
# If using wkhtmltopdf, then place YAML header at top of document
# whether your header uses latex or html syntax depends on what engine is preparing your documents
# geometry is used only by LaTeX geometry package
