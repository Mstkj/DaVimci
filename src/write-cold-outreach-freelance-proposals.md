Drafting a cold pitch



Perhaps, use Mailchimp for marketing

Use their name in the subject line when it makes sense.

Make the subject line as specific as possible

The more personal the subject, the higher the open rate

The term professionalism is often confused with the notion of an actor
portraying a fictional character. Be professional, but not disingenuous.
If you wonder if your email sounds like a marketing email, then it
probably *is*.

Always deliver in your email what is promised in your subject line. As
the divergence between the subject line and body text increases, so to
does the open rate and low quality responses.

**Step 1: Start With an Irresistible Headline**

headline "Content at {Company}".

**Step 2: Personalize**

Be professional, but be yourself. Don't portray a fictitious character.
Don't simply say "hi." Anyone remotely busy would disregard an email
with this beginning.

**Step 3 - State your purpose**

"*I'm reaching out to see if you need someone who can help with content
at {Company}*".

Step 4 - Introduce Yourself and Establish Credibility

"*I'm Bamidele Onibalusi. I've been featured in Forbes, Huffington Post
and Digital Journal, and I run blogs that have been read by millions of
people over the past few years.*"

**Step 5 - Outline Your Services**

"*I can help with writing blog posts, guest posts, resources,
newsletters, landing page content and any of your other content
marketing needs.*"

**Step 6 - Conclude and encourage them to reply**

Hi \[first name\],

My name is \[my name\] and I head up business development efforts with
\[my company\]. We recently launched a new platform that \[one sentence
pitch\].

I am taking an educated stab in the dark here, however based on your
online profile, you appear to be an appropriate person to connect with
\... or might at least point me in the right direction.

I'd like to speak with someone from \[company\] who is responsible for
\[handling something that\'s relevant to my product\].

If that's you, are you open to a fifteen minute call on
\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_ \[time and date\] to discuss ways the \[company
name\] platform can specifically help your business? If not you, can you
please put me in touch with the right person?

I appreciate the help!

Best,

[SIG]

Project: Client Name, Website Development, Content Writing, and Editing
Needs: Potential client cites a website that is not "up to par" for attracting grantors and other stakeholders. The client also asks for a more human service-oriented feel.
Solution: In communicating with potential grantors, employees, clients, and other users, the verbiage of your website is of the utmost importance. Fortunately, conveying an open and welcoming tone is easily accomplished with the "right" copy.
Who We Are: GardenWall Publications LLC is a content and copy development agency based in Lansing, Michigan. Principal writer and owner Allena Tapia earned a BA in English from Michigan State University, interning at both non-profits and magazine publishers. Following full-time editorial and marketing work with Lansing Community College and Michigan State University, Tapia launched GardenWall Publications to provide copy and content on a freelance basis. Staff includes contractual, administrative assistants, translators, and proofreaders.

Credibility/Experience: A comprehensive client list is included as Appendix 1 with this proposal. (Appendixes are a normal part of RFPs). An appendix lists national-level clientele willing to provide reference and comments on past GWP LLC deliverables. Related clientele includes non-profits like the Example Client Name and Another Example Client Name. SEO-specific experience is provided by Another Past Client Name. This client is an industry leader in SEO work and spares no expense in training writers like Tapia in the latest SEO practices, which change daily. SEO experience and continuing exposure to Google's ever-changing rules ensure that your SEO pages and costs are not money wasted.
Deliverability:  (This is the nitty-gritty, very important pieces to include in your RFP.) Copy, as described in features below, is deliverable via Word documents and email within the timeframe stated (per client's RFP). Vendor guarantees deliverables and cites past client satisfaction as proof of deliverability of project.
Vendor Accessibility: Vendor website is hosted at Example Website. The vendor is reachable Monday through Friday from 8a-5p EST via phone (517) xxx-xxxx and email xxx@gmail.com.
